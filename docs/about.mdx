## about this book

Today's AI frameworks excel at building prototypes. But when autonomous agents need to run reliably and continuously in production, developers are on their own.

**This book bridges the critical gap between prototype and production.**

While many resources focus on building chatbots or automating simple tasks, this book tackles the hard problems that emerge when agents must operate autonomously and continuously at scale.

### who this book is for

This book is written for:

- Technical leaders responsible for architectural decisions
- Software engineers designing reliable, scalable agentic applications

This book assumes you have:

- Programming experience in at least one modern language (TypeScript, Python, etc.)
- Basic understanding of APIs, distributed systems, and database concepts
- Basic understanding of AI and LLMs

### approach and philosophy

This book takes a first-principles approach to agentic systems. Instead of promoting today's frameworks that will be obsolete tomorrow, we focus on fundamental patterns and principles that outlast any particular implementation.

Every concept moves from theory to practice, introducing dependable mental models as well as realistic code samples to build a holistic understanding of agentic systems.

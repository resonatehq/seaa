:::tip Developer interface

The Programming Model defines the developer interface of Distributed Async Await, and how to provide a sequential looking programming model on top of a distributed and concurrent platform.

:::

Distributed Async Await, like _async/await_, builds on two abstractions, functions and promises.
Functions are a universal abstraction for computation, promises are a universal abstraction for coordination.

Functions compose recursively, that is, a function may call other functions spanning a Call Graph.
The Call Graph provides a flexible lens onto a computation.
The call graph is zoomable, allowing one to expand a caller into its callees, treating a function as a composite, or collapse those callees into the caller, treating the function as atomic.
This flexibility enables reasoning at different levels of abstraction.

import { LabeledDiagram } from "@site/src/components/LabeledDiagram/LabeledDiagram";

Generically, a Call Graph is a directed graph where the nodes are functions and the edges are calls between functions.

Within the context of the Distributed Async Await specification, and all implementations of it, a Call Graph is the full set of promises and executions from ephemeral edge to ephemeral edge.
That is — a Call Graph is a map of the durable world.

In the Distributed Async Await specification, all execution invocations pair with a promise.

An execution can be either a function execution or some action that must be taken outside of the system, such as a human clicking a button.

A Call Graph can illustrate locality — that is, an execution can display its locality in relation to other executions.
This is called a Distributed Call Graph.

![Execution locality](/img/execution-locality.svg)

A Call Graph is zoomable — that is, it can show the full set of promises and executions, or it can show just the root executions.
Consider the following pseudo-code, where `foo()` and `bar()` are in process a, and `baz()` is in process b.

process a:

```text
func foo():
    r = await (async_local bar())
    return r

func bar():
    r = await (async_remote baz())
    return r
```

process b:

```text
func baz():
    return 1
```

If the Call Graph zooms in on all the promises, function executions, and localities (details, concurrency, and distribution), it would look like this:

This same call structure can assume promises and the Call Graph can just show the function executions.

To show just the distributed nature of the application, we can zoom out and show just the root executions of each process.

## Local and Remote

When a function calls another function within the same process it is called a Local Function Invocation (LFI).

When a function calls another function in a different Application Node, it is considered a Remote Function Invocation (RFI).

{/* ![Diagram of an RFI Call Graph](/img/rfc-call-graph.svg) */}

A Resonate Application can make use of both LFIs and RFIs, and thus a Resoante Call Graph can span just one or many Application Nodes.

## Root promises

There are two types of root promises.
The first is the root promise of an Application Node (process), and the second is the root promise of a Call Graph.

An Application Node root promise (also known as the process) is the promise associated with the first execution in an Application Node.
In other words, this is the execution invoked by `resonate.run()`.

A Call Graph root promise is the promise associated with the first execution in a Call Graph.
This execution is also invoked by `resonate.run()`, but it is on the "edge" and is typically the entry point into the application.
